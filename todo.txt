Project Idea: URL Shortener Service

Description: In this project, you will build a URL shortener service, similar to Bitly or TinyURL. The service will take long URLs and generate shortened versions of them, which can be used to redirect users to the original long URL. Users can then share the shortened URLs easily, making it convenient for them to access the original link.

Features:

    URL Shortening: Users can submit a long URL to the service, and the system will generate a unique short code for that URL.
    URL Redirection: When users access the shortened URL, the system will redirect them to the original long URL.
    Custom Short Codes: Allow users to customize the short code for their URLs (optional feature).
    Analytics: Keep track of the number of times each shortened URL is accessed and provide basic analytics for users (e.g., number of clicks, location of users, etc.).
    User Authentication: Implement user accounts and authentication to allow users to manage their shortened URLs.
    Expiration of URLs: Allow users to set an expiration date for their shortened URLs if they only want them to be valid for a certain period.
    API: Provide a RESTful API for URL shortening and retrieval, allowing other applications to integrate with your service.
    Admin Panel: Create an admin panel for managing system-wide settings and viewing analytics across all URLs.

Technical Considerations:

    Use GoLang to build the backend server, handle URL shortening, and redirection.
    Use a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) to store the original URLs, shortened URLs, and other related data.
    Implement a caching mechanism to improve the performance of URL redirections.
    Use a URL routing library (e.g., Gorilla Mux) to handle HTTP requests and route them to the appropriate handlers.
    Implement proper error handling and validation to ensure the service is robust and secure.
